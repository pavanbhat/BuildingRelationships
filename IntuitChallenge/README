Files in this directory:

1. clean_and_prep.py:  
This file is the starter code and must be run in order to parse the data that has been distributed into multiple .csv files. This file contains a main method, and therefore needs to run on its own. It has to be placed in the folder where the input .csv files (user-0.csv etc.) are placed. 

2. trainMLP: Needs to be run after clean_and_prep.py and when prompted on the console please enter 5. It also requires you to keep closing the figure() window which pops up with a graph. (Will mostly pop up twice after you enter 5 in the console). This takes quite some time to run. Kindly, be patient!

3. executeMLP: Needs to be run after trainMLP.py and when prompted on the console please enter 5. This takes quite some time to run. Kindly, be patient! On the console displays a confusion matrix that works as a rubric to determine whether learning is being performed and how much accuracy it has achieved.

4. The Data Set: Mint Financial Transaction Data


********Order in which files need to be run is 1 , 2 , and then 3**********

The accuracy keeps increasing as the number of epochs keep increasing.

***************************Required*****************************************

Python: Pycharm / Anaconda IDE
Packages Needed: sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, csv, math, random, numpy+mkl
****************************************************************************

Note: The trainMLP.py generates a weights file which will be used by the executeMLP.py so the order in which it is run is important.

I have only tested this on the Windows OS.

Kindly, ignore some extra code such as other classifiers, imports etc. that I could not finish for extra checks and functionality :)
